## Introduction
Some grounds could not be made in GroundForge, only as "Droste". To make it easier to play with, this page consists of several forms to make playing easier.


## Woble
{% capture descr1 %}
This ground was invented by J. Pol. The units of the rose-ground are placed in different directions. After completing the stitches, press <span class="elem">go</span> and then the <span class="elem">wand</span> in the advanced section. (This needs some more text, and a picture that shows what goes where.)
