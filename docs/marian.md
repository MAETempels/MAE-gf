## Introduction
In this article some of my own designs and finds. Most grounds I found before I learned of Groundforge. Of course, some of them might also have been created by others.   
Most grounds I name the units with an addition to the placing of the units in the ground. Some units are used in more than one example, so also the name.

## Fusion

  alt="pic fusion"
  description="The traditional units separated with plaits. Ground mt-0116 uses the rose-ground unit; mt-0342 uses the snowflake-unit;  mt-0278 the bias-unit. Please note: the plaits should stay plaits."

* [mt-0116][G-0116-KF], [mt-0342][G-0342-KF] (UU 3054), [mt-0278][G-0278-KF]

  description="Ground mt-0342 is meant to be made with pins at the sides of the snowflake-unit, as shown in the picture. The unit resembles [UU 3054], without the side pins, en without crossing at the corners. The ground came into being as a half stitch spider, but forgetting the twitst at te start and end."

## Sunny stitch
{% capture maet1 %}
This stitch I created because I wished to see a little loop at the sides of the rose ground. To obtain this, I used a very onorthodox stitch. The colour grey indicates <span class="stch">cross only</span>. Ground mt-0902-f connects the sunny's with plaits; ground mt-0902-q is the same unit, in a square.

* [mt-0902-f][G-0902-f], [mt-0902-q][G-0902-q]

## Ants
Ants came to life as a variation of the Slavic ground. The result looks like ants, see example 2. In effect, the threads between the bottom and top position of two units will be <span class="stch">crossed</span> four times. Please note that there are no twists between the <span class="stch">cross only</span> and <span class="stch">whole stitch</span> at the pins.

* [mt-0692][ex-0692], [mt-0665][ex-0665], [3 paired crossed star][ex-3cc]        

## Another fish
The following pattern I created one quarter turned, so you had to work "upwards" from one square to another. As Groundforge does not support going upwards, I used the diagram given in the picture and in the examples.

* [Another fish][ex-funny-fish], [original ground][ex-mine2] (after turning one quarter)

## Bias and Paris ground
As the pattern above, this pattern also was created one quarter turned.

* [example][ex-mine1]

## Short Bias
Take just one unit of the Bias ground and place them all in the same direction (mt-0228-s), or in alternating directions (mt-0228-a). The latter may give nice results in two colours.

![same direction][pic-0228-OG] ![alternating][pic-0228-OGy] ![short bias foto][foto-0228-OGy] 
* [mt-0228-s][G-0228-OG], [mt-0228-a][G-0228-OGy]
