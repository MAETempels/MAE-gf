### Introduction
In this article some of my own designs and finds. Most grounds I found before I learned of Groundforge. Of course, some of them might also have been created by others.

### Lace lintje
<span class="central">![lees lintje][pic-ll]</span>          
A few years ago I designed this small bookmark. The name is a pun upon the dutch word for "read" "lees", which is pronounced the same as "lace". "Lintje" means "ribbon".            
Clearly, this pattern as such can not be made with Groundforge, however, there is a close by. Please note: play only with the stitches of the rose-unit. The plaits, specified with <span class="stch">ctctctct</span> or <span class="stch">ctctctctc</span>, should stay plaits.

### Sunny stitch
This stitch I created because I wished to see a little loop at the sides of the rose ground. To obtain this, I used a very onorthodox stitch.

The colour grey indicates <span class="stch">cross only</span>.

### Ants
Ants came to life as a variation of the Slavic ground. The result looks like ants, see example 2. In effect, the threads between the bottom and top position of two units will be <span class="stch">crossed</span> four times. Please note that there are no twists between the <span class="stch">cross only</span> and <span class="stch">whole stitch</span> at the pins.
