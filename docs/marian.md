## Introduction
In this article some of my own designs and finds. Most grounds I found before I learned of Groundforge. Of course, some of them might also have been created by others.   
For most grounds I only use names for the units with an addition to indicate the placing of the units in the ground. E.g. in plaits, in a square, traditional, ... Some units are used in more than one example, with different placings, so naturally those names show up more than once.   
The colour grey in the working diagrams indicates <span class="stch">cross only</span>.

## Fusion

  alt="pic fusion"
  description="The traditional units separated with plaits. Ground mt-0116 uses the rose-ground unit; mt-0342 the snowflake-unit;  mt-0278 the bias-unit. Please note: the plaits should stay plaits."

* [mt-0116][G-0116-KF], [mt-0342][G-0342-KF], [mt-0278][G-0278-KF]

  description="Ground mt-0342 is meant to be made with pins at the sides of the snowflake-unit, as shown in the picture. The ground came into being as a half stitch spider, but forgetting the twitst at the corners. The unit resembles [UU 3054], which has no side pins, and does not cross at the corners."
%}  

## Sunny stitch
{% capture maet1 %}
This stitch I created because I wished to see a little loop at the sides of the rose ground. To obtain this, I used a very onorthodox stitch at the sides of the unit. Ground mt-0902-f connects the sunny's with plaits; ground mt-0902-q is the same unit, in a square.

* [mt-0902-f][G-0902-f], [mt-0902-q][G-0902-q]

## Ants
Ants came to life as a variation of the Slavic ground. The result looks like ants, see mt-0665. In effect, the threads between the bottom and top position of two units will be <span class="stch">crossed</span> four times. Please note that there are no twists between the <span class="stch">cross only</span> and <span class="stch">whole stitch</span> at the pins.

* [mt-0692][ex-0692], [mt-0665][ex-0665], [3 paired crossed star][ex-3cc]        

## Another fish
The following patterns I created one quarter turned, so you had to work "upwards" from one square to another. As Groundforge does not support going upwards, I changed this into the diagram given in the picture and in the examples.

* [mt-1114][G-1114], [mt-1111][G-1111] (after turning one quarter)

## Bias and Paris ground
As the pattern above, this pattern also was created one quarter turned.

* [mt-2111][G-2111]

## Double Bias

  alt="pic 07 3x"
  description="The pictures on the left show three different units. The one on the left is one unit of ground [WI F4]. The matrix for this ground turned out to be equivalent to the bias-ground. Experimenting with stitches, I created the units in the middle and the right. The matrix of the ground in the middle turned out to be equivalent to the little snowflake. The one on the right proved to be a real surprise! See the example. (The units are placed like the white tiles on a checker board.)"
