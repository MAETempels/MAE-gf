### Introduction
In this article some of my own designs and finds. Most grounds I found before I learned of Groundforge. Of course, some of them might also have been created by others.

### Sunny stitch
{% capture maet1 %}
This stitch I created because I wished to see a little loop at the sides of the rose ground. To obtain this, I used a very onorthodox stitch. The colour grey indicates <span class="stch">cross only</span>.   
{% endcapture %}

* [sunny stitch in plaits][G-0902-f], [sunny stitch in square][G-0902-q]

### Ants
Ants came to life as a variation of the Slavic ground. The result looks like ants, see example 2. In effect, the threads between the bottom and top position of two units will be <span class="stch">crossed</span> four times. Please note that there are no twists between the <span class="stch">cross only</span> and <span class="stch">whole stitch</span> at the pins.

### Another fish
The following pattern I created one quarter turned, so you had to work "upwards" from one square to another. As Groundforge does not support going upwards, I used the pricking given in the picture and in the examples.

### Bias and Paris ground
As the pattern above, this pattern also was created one quarter turned.
