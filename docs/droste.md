## Introduction
Some grounds could not be made in GroundForge, only as "Droste-effect". To make it easier to play with, this page consists of several forms to make playing easier. See page [_Droste-effect_][pg-droste] on the Groundforge help-pages for more information.

## Woble
This ground was discoverd by J. Pol, as a level 2 ground, starting with the "alternate stitch" ground. The units are placed in different directions. The following examples use the same units, but of course combinations can be made. Please note: work in horizontal rows of units.

### With rose ground unit
