## Introduction
Some grounds could not be made in GroundForge, only as "Droste-effect". To make it easier to play with, this page consists of several forms to make playing easier. See page [_Droste-effect_][pg-droste] on the Groundforge help-pages for more information.

## Woble
{% capture descr1 %}
This ground was invented by J. Pol. The units of the rose-ground are placed in different directions. After completing the stitches, press <span class="elem">go</span> and then the <span class="elem">wand</span> in the advanced section. (This needs some more text, and a picture that shows what goes where.)
