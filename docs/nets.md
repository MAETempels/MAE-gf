## Introduction
Net grounds are grounds with repeats of usualy one stitch. There are several ways of placing the stitches:                 
![net1][p-net1] ![net2][p-net2] ![net3][p-net3] ![net4][p-net4]    

Now, it gets more interesting, if we would use two of more different stitches. These grounds are known as "chaotic ground", "alternating ground", ...

Please note: the following is equivalent to the second.          
![net2x][p-net2x]

[p-net1]: ../images/net1.png
[p-net2]: ../images/net2.png
[p-net3]: ../images/net3.png
[p-net4]: ../images/net4.png
[p-net2x]: ../images/net2x.png?align=right

## Horizontal net
![example 1][p-net1a]  ![example 2][p-net1b]  ![example 3][p-net1c]      

![example 4][p-net1d]  

[p-net1a]: ../images/net1a.png
[p-net1b]: ../images/net1b.png
[p-net1c]: ../images/net1c.png
[p-net1d]: ../images/net1d.png

## Vertical net
![example 1][p-net2a]  ![example 3][p-net2c]    

[p-net2a]: ../images/net2a.png
[p-net2c]: ../images/net2c.png

## Honeycomb net 1
![example 1][p-net3]

[p-net3]: ../images/net3.png

## Honeycomb net 2
![example 1][p-net4]

[p-net4]: ../images/net41.png
