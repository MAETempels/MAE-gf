## Introduction
Net grounds are grounds with repeats of one stitch. There are several ways of placing the stitches:
![net1][p-net1] ![net2][p-net2] ![net3][p-net3] ![net4][p-net4]    

Please note: the following is equivalent to the second.
![net2x][p-net2x]

[p-net1]: ../images/net1.png
[p-net2]: ../images/net2.png
[p-net3]: ../images/net3.png
[p-net4]: ../images/net4.png
[p-net2x]: ../images/net2x.png
