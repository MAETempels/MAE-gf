## Introduction
On these pages you will find many examples of grounds. Some examples are traditional. Others are our own finds. It is of course possible, that someone else has discovered the same ground.    
If you, or someone you know, has been identified as creator of one or more of the grounds used: please let us know.

Groundforge uses scheme's (matrices) as input-parameter. Some of those are discovered by V. Irvine, and collected in the "Tesselace", others, like the spiders, are created by ourselves. Of course, coïncidences happen.

Some new grounds use traditional prickings. E.g.: the "ants" are made on the rose-ground pricking.

## Copyright
In the examples our own grounds are named prefixed with our initials. You can use the grounds if you mention where you have found the ground. E.g. "ground by J. Pol, found on Groundforge Example Pages".

## License
will be covered later this year
