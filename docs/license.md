## Introduction
On the pages of this website you will find many examples of grounds. Some examples are traditional. Others are our own finds. It is of course possible, that someone else has discovered the same ground.    
If you, or someone you know, has been identified as creator of one or more of the grounds used, without being named as such: please let us know so we can add the reference.

Groundforge uses scheme's (matrices) as input-parameter. Some of those are discovered by V. Irvine, and collected in the "Tesselace", others, like the spiders, are created by ourselves. Of course, coïncidences happen.

Some new grounds use traditional prickings. E.g.: the "ants" are made on the rose-ground pricking.

## Creators
Our own grounds are prefixed with our initials (jp-, mt-).   
Grounds found in the Whiting index (prefixed WI) are free of copyrights.     
Grounds otherwise prefixed have been published elsewhere. See the _reference_ section below.
Grounds not prefixed are traditional grounds.     

All images are created by J. Pol, M. Tempels, or Groundforge, except where otherwise noted.
Most of the images are created using Knipling &reg; (&copy; Petra Pönisch Verlag).
