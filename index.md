### Introduction
On these pages you find pages with additional patterns for use in Groundforge, made by [Jo Pol][gf-jo]. Given are the parameter-section and, in most cases, stitches, although not always traditional.

### How to use these pages
All examples are links to the Groundforge main page. Follow the link and click <span class="elem">SHOW</span> in the <span class="elem">PAIR/THREAD DIAGRAM</span> section. Please feel free to play with the stitches. E.g. try what happens if you change the default <span class="stch">ctc</span> of the spiders or fish in <span class="stch">ct</span>.       
The examples use pair-diagrams in the styled version (_matrix-scheme_) that Groundforge understands. If you wish to see this scheme, click <span class="elem">DIAGRAM</span>.
Most of the patterns also have a scheme in the TesseLace index. Some, as the spiders and the larger fishes, don't.

### Diagrams
<p align="center"><img alt="several types of drawings" src="https://maetempels.github.io/MAE-gf/images/gf%20picts.png"></p>

On these pages several types of diagrams are used, as illustrated in the picture. On the left is a drawing of a _pair-diagram_ or _working-scheme_. Pins, pinpositions and colourcode are given as needed for the actual lace. In the middle the ground is drawn schematic, to given an impression. Pins and colourcode may or may not be drawn. The pinpositions are drawn as required for the actual lace. On the right the _matrix-scheme_ that Groundforge understands. In the articles the name _scheme_ or _diagram_ will be used for all types of the drawings.                     
Several grounds have more than one working matrix-scheme, as is explained in de Groundforge-userguide.    

The example is a variation on a 's Gravenmoers snowflake ground. See [here][ex-0306] how the thread-diagram looks like.      

The pictures in this wiki are mostly made with Knipling (TM).

### References
WI = [Whiting index][wi-index]. Jo Edkins created an annotated online index on the grounds in _A Lace Guide for Makers and Collectors_ by Gertrude Whiting which dates from 1920.       

### Disclaimer
All links worked when created. Due to work on the Groundforge coding, there may be hiccups. There is a work-around, but I have to study this first.           

English is not my native language, so please forgive me any mistakes.
