### Introduction
On this website you find pages with additional patterns for use in Groundforge, a webapplication made by [Jo Pol][gf-jo]. Given are the parameter-section and, in most cases, stitches, although not always traditional.

### How to use these pages
All examples are links to the Groundforge main page. Follow the link and click <span class="elem">SHOW</span> in the <span class="elem">PAIR/THREAD DIAGRAM</span> section. Please feel free to play with the stitches. E.g. try what happens if you change the default <span class="stch">ctc</span> of the spiders or fish in <span class="stch">ct</span>.       
The examples use pair-diagrams in the styled version (_matrix-scheme_) that Groundforge understands. If you wish to see this scheme, click <span class="elem">DIAGRAM</span>.
Most of the patterns also have a scheme in the TesseLace index. Some, as the spiders and the larger fishes, don't.

### Disclaimer
All links worked when created. Due to work on the Groundforge coding, there may be hiccups. There is a work-around, but I have to study this first.           

English is not my native language, so please forgive me any mistakes.
